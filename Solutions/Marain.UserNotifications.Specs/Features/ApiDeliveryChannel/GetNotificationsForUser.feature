Feature: Get Notifications For User

# IMPORTANT: Because all the setup/teardown is per feature, every spec in this feature that creates data for the scenario
# should use a different user Id to avoid conflicts.

Scenario: Request notifications for a user
	Given I have created and stored 25 notifications in the current transient tenant with timestamps at 30 second intervals for the user with Id 'user100'
	And I have created and stored 5 notifications in the current transient tenant with timestamps at 30 second intervals for the user with Id 'user101'
